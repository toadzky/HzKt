# HzKt
This is a bundle for Dropwizard to add a [Horizon](www.horizon.io). The node server version was frustrating me when I wanted to connect a simple rest endpoint. So I decided to port the whole server to the JVM (I'm using Kotlin) and make it easy to throw into Dropwizard (my preferred microservice framework).
